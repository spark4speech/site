Not only is our entire codebase, from this website to the app itself, open source on {GitHub}{https://github.com/spark4speech}, but we have also open sourced all of our {finances}{https://hcb.hackclub.com/spark4speech} in the name of transparency. We are committed to keeping our software free and accessible, forever.",
